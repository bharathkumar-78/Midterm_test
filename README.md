# INTRODUCTION
This Olympic data analysis provides valuable insights into athlete participation trends, medal distribution by country, and variations in athlete demographics. By visualizing global medal achievements, changes in participation across years, and attributes such as age, height, and weight, this analysis offers a comprehensive look at Olympic history and performance. Through interactive dashboards and a cohesive story, viewers can explore how different age groups, genders, and countries have contributed to Olympic successes, gaining a deeper understanding of the evolution and impact of the Olympic Games.

# DATA/OPERATIONS ABSTRACTION DESIGN
The dataset used in this analysis includes a range of variables on Olympic athletes, events, and medals, derived from a historical Olympic dataset "https://www.olympedia.org/statistics/medal/country" . Only the most relevant fields were used, and several new variables, such as aggregate medal counts and categorized age groups, were created to enhance analysis. Data preparation involved cleaning, type adjustments, and handling minor missing values to ensure accuracy. This structured approach made the dataset manageable and effective for visualization in Tableau, enabling clear and meaningful insights.

# FUTURE WORK
As of now, no further work is planned. However, the current analysis offers a solid foundation for exploring Olympic data and can be expanded if new trends or additional data become available in the future. The existing dashboards provide a comprehensive view of participation, demographics, and medal distribution, meeting the initial goals of the project effectively.
